# Report Cards Redesign — Implementation Log

This file is a running record of which implementation units have been completed, when, by whom, and with what outcome. Every agent that completes an implementation MUST append an entry here before their work is considered done.

## Log entry template

When you finish an implementation, append an entry to the **Completions** section below using exactly this format:

```markdown
### Implementation NN: <title>

- **Completed at:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (local time)
- **Completed by:** <agent identifier or session id>
- **Branch / commit:** `<branch-name>` @ `<commit-sha>`
- **Pull request:** <PR URL if applicable, or "direct to main">
- **Status:** ✅ complete | ⚠️ partial | ❌ blocked
- **Summary:** One or two sentences on what was built.

**What changed:**

- File 1 — brief purpose
- File 2 — brief purpose
- …

**Database changes:**

- Migration: `<migration name>` — brief description
- New tables: …
- New columns: …
- (none, if no DB change)

**Test coverage:**

- Unit specs added: N
- Integration/E2E specs added: N
- RLS leakage tests: per new table, confirmed passing
- `turbo test` status: ✅ all green | ⚠️ skipped reason | ❌ failing reason
- `turbo lint` status: ✅ | ❌
- `turbo type-check` status: ✅ | ❌

**Architecture docs updated (if applicable):**

- `docs/architecture/module-blast-radius.md` — updated | not required
- `docs/architecture/event-job-catalog.md` — updated | not required
- `docs/architecture/state-machines.md` — updated | not required
- `docs/architecture/danger-zones.md` — updated | not required

**Regression check:**

- Ran full `turbo test`: ✅ all green | ❌ failures (list below)
- Any unrelated test failures: none | <list>

**Blockers or follow-ups:**

- None, OR describe any blockers/handoffs the next implementation needs to know about

**Notes for the next agent:**

- Any non-obvious context that might trip them up
```

## Rules for agents writing entries

1. **Only append — never rewrite or delete prior entries.** Prior entries are the audit trail.
2. **Commit the log file update in the same PR as the implementation.** The log must reflect merged state.
3. **If the implementation is partial, mark it ⚠️ partial, describe what was done, and create a new entry when the remainder lands.** Do not retroactively edit the ⚠️ entry.
4. **If the implementation is blocked, mark it ❌ blocked, describe the blocker, and hand off to the user.** A blocked entry is still a valid log entry.
5. **Link the commit SHA.** No log entry is complete without a traceable commit.
6. **Include the `turbo test` / `turbo lint` / `turbo type-check` results.** If any failed, explain why and whether it was unrelated.
7. **Check the architecture docs.** If your implementation added a cross-module dependency, a new job, a new state machine, or new coupling, update the relevant file in `docs/architecture/` — and note that in the log entry.
